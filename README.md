This is a web based calculator project.

It is part of the Odin's project curriculum assignment.

Notes for keyboard usage:

      for multiplication, use the asterik (*) key without the parathensis
  
      for division, use the slash (/) key without the paranthesis
  
      to clear the screen, use the "c" key without the quotes
      
      to delete a number or operator, use the "backspace" key without the quotes
      
      to get the result of an operation, simply press '=' or 'enter' or 'return'
      key without the quotes.
      
General information: 

      to perform factorial or percentage operations, enter the numbers either by 
      clicking on the on-screen buttons or by typing them via the keyboard followed 
      by '!' for factorial and '%' for percentage without the quotes for each case.
      you don't need to press 'enter' or click on '=', the calculator performs and 
      displays the result of the operation automatically
  
      this calculator was built with a minimalistic philosophy for its design and usage 
      so most features and capabilities of typical scientific calculators are not present in this
      app.

      this app was built mainly for desktop usage without much thought given to smaller
      displays (i lack the skills to implement a fully functional responsive layout for
      all screen sizes at this time).
    
Thanks for stopping by!  :)
